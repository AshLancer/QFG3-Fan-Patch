[Changes in Version 1.2A](#changes-in-version-12a)


# Changes in Version 1.3.1A:


### 19:

- Version number.


### 290:

- Fixed the dreaded "Salim forgets the Dispel Potion ingredients" bug. A very rare dead end could occur when delivering the ingredients for the dispel potion one-at-a-time to Salim. He would sometimes "forget" that he received them at all and refuse to make the potion or accept any more copies of ingredients. This would prevent the player from continuing the game, as the Dispel Potion is a plot-critical item.


### 380:

- The Paladin will no longer play a Sense Danger message if there are no vines in the room.

- Fixed a script error where the game wasn't correctly setting the player into wait mode when the Hero entered to meet with the rescued baby meerbat.

### 420:

- Fixed a bug where the outcome of the initiation contest only depended on whether or not you won the wrestling challenge and disregarded all of the other challenges. The game will now keep track of how many times you've won and the Hero will win the contest if he beats Yesufu in at least 3 of the 5 challenges.

- Fixed a script error where if the Thief escaped the Laibon's Hut without the drum, he would erroneously exit through the front entrance and directly in front of the guard.

- Fixed a message reference error that was preventing the Laibon's last line from playing after finishing the race.

- Restored the missing 10 points for winning the initiation contest.

- Restored lines that the Laibon was supposed to speak at the end of the initiation contest.

- You can now beat Yesufu at the foot race if you left him trapped in the hole. This will count as a win towards the contest, and regardless of who finishes the race first, you are still awarded 5 points.


### 430:

- Fixed a script error where asking Uhura about Prisoner was causing her to leave prematurely and preventing the player from seeing additional dialogue topics.

- Variable changes needed for room 420.


### 620:

- Fixed a script error where it was possible to interrupt parts of the dance script by bringing up the icon bar. You can no longer bring up the icon bar during this sequence.

- I had cut a specific line in the last build where Johari would interrupt the Wizard and force him to talk about magic. It had no corresponding dialogue topic and was placed at inappropriate locations to block other valid messages. You can now hear it again by clicking on Tell About Spear, which I have added to the teller during the initial meeting.

- After the Leopardman Shaman challenges the Wizard to a duel, you can once again Tell About Magic as an alternative way of accepting. Turns out that this was actually an intended dialogue topic, but it was linked to an erroneous response and I shouldn't have removed it. I've since discovered the correct text that was supposed to go with this topic and restored it.


### 630:

- Fixed a lockup that would occur when the Thief either tried to jump or ducked to avoid the leopard and his stamina fell below zero. He will now fall to his death if he attempts to jump or duck with low stamina, and play a rarely seen death message.

- Fixed a script error where ducking was only draining the Thief's stamina when he used it to avoid the leopard.

- Fixed script errors with the following spells in this room: Detect Magic, Trigger, Dazzle, Calm, and Reversal.

- Disabled the following spells in this room: Open, Fetch, and Levitate (were causing lockups).

- You can now levitate up and down from the pedestal.

- You can no longer climb the pedestal without having points in Climbing.


### 820:
